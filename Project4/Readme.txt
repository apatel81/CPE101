#Project 4 - Word Puzzle
#Name: Haley Childress and Ajay Patel 
#Professor: S. Einakian
#Section: 1

We each began by working on the functions by ourselves, specifically the input function during
the early stages of thr project. Starting Monday, May 14th, we met at CPE Tutoring hours and 
worked on making the functions together, working through formatting, errors, and inplementation. 
We met at CPE tutoring Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and continued to work on the 
project until it was finished and all tests passed. Also, we additionally met on Wednesday after
class. The work was split evenly amongst us and we each contributed equally.
